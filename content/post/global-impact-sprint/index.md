🎓 I had the incredible honor of representing my Department of Technology Management & Innovation at NYU Tandon School of Engineering in this year's #GlobalImpactSprint hosted by the Hasso Plattner Institute.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
🌱 Fifteen outstanding students were carefully selected from prestigious institutions such as New York University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Babson College, and Tecnológico de Monterrey. Our mission was to devise a solution that connects local stakeholders and initiatives crucial to resolving the global plastic pollution crisis, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Under Water.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
🏃 We were granted a total of 100 hours spread over five days, adhering to the #DesignSprint process outlined in Jake Knapp's influential book, #Sprint.

🗺️ <strong>Day 1: Map:</strong> This day presented us with an extraordinary opportunity to conduct in-depth interviews with key stakeholders in the field. We sought to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current situation, and their primary concerns, and identify countries at the forefront of circular economy efforts. Armed with this valuable insight, we defined our target stakeholders as a team, along with the questions we aimed to address by the end of the week.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I was taken aback by the noteworthy endeavors of developing nations like India and the Philippines in embracing a circular economy, while the West has made remarkable strides in waste management.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I was happy to uncover the existence of remarkable companies like Ligo, a digital ecosystem platform driving scientific innovation in sustainability, and Biointellectus, an industry leader in bioplastics. Engaging with professionals from these organizations allowed me to glean profound insights. In particular, Ana Patricia Ortiz Ríos, the CEO of Ligo, imparted wisdom that has left an indelible mark on me. She astutely emphasized that plastic should not be vilified as a monster but rather it is an incredible product. However, our attention should be directed towards optimizing its consumption and implementing improved waste management strategies.

✍ <strong>Day 2: Sketch:</strong> A day dedicated to profound contemplation and brainstorming, we delved into meticulous research of existing competing solutions, seeking to improve upon them. As the day drew to a close, each team member sketched their solution in intricate detail, setting the stage for further discussion.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Graciously, the organizing team at #HPI arranged a visit to the United Nations Headquarters in #newyorkcity. Standing in the same room as esteemed dignitaries working on global issues was an immensely enriching experience, etched forever in my memory.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
🌏 <strong>Day 3: Decide:</strong> Collectively, we deliberated on the most promising features from each sketch, piecing them together into a new comprehensive sketch. We then crafted a compelling storyboard, carefully selecting the ideal persona to effectively communicate our solution.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
💻 <strong>Day 4: Prototype:</strong> We built a high-fidelity prototype on #figma, simulating our product to prepare for testing with customers the following day.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
🧐 <strong>Day 5: Test:</strong> The moment of truth arrived as we conducted 1:1 interviews, subjecting our prototype to rigorous scrutiny. These crucial interactions allowed us to validate our assumptions and gather invaluable feedback, which we used to iterate and refine our prototype for the final presentation.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
💙 <u>In conclusion</u>, this experience stands as one of the most remarkable I have encountered in New York City. Collaborating with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, all working harmoniously towards a shared goal, imparted invaluable lessons that will resonate with me forever. I am profoundly grateful for this opportunity to go beyond mere conversations about #sustainability and actively contribute to something that holds the power to transform our world for the better.
